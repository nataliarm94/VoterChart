	<h1>Historic Midterm Turnout Can Be Linked to Increase in Voter Registration</h1>
	
	<h2> Recent data shows that voter registration in Brooklyn has increased by 11% since 2014's Midterm Elections. </h2>

<p> In the wake of last Tuesday's Midterm elections, early data shows that voter turnout was significantly higher than previous years. Historically, New York has been considered a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/new-yorks-worst-in-the-country-voting-system/570223/">non-voting State</a>. This can be linked to the fact that New York does not have early voting--which would help thousands of people who can't take the day off from work to vote--and places tough restrictions on absentee voting. In Brooklyn, data shows that since the 2014 Midterm Elections, voter registration rose over 11%, making it the highest it's ever been in the borough. </p>

<p>The biggest issue with a higher voter registration is that New York is not equipped to handle large voting masses. Long lines, broken voting machines, and understaffed polling sites are only a handfull of the issues that took place on Tuesday. Nevertheless, The increase of registration and participation in the last five years predicts that even more people will be registering and heading out to vote in the 2020 Presidential Elections. </p>


<p>"I've never seen so many people be so motivated," said Ari Wolf, having just finished voting in Sunset Park. "I feel like it has a lot to do with Trump. The decision makers of this country don't seem to have the people in mind, and I feel like everyone is tired of it." </p>

<p>Because New York is considered a blue state, it's no surprise that the Democratic Party led with registration numbers. Governor Andrew Cuomo was once again re-elected during last Tuesday's elections by 22 points. Even though he ran--and won--as a Democrat, in 2014 he helped found the Women's Equality Party (WEP) with hopes to give women their own voice in New York politocs. Many accused him of trying to take away votes from the Republican Party. WEP seems to have taken the biggest hit in registrations. Starting off with over 30,000 registrations in it's first year, the women's gained only 876 registrations this year.  </p>
