	<h1>Historic Midterm Turnout Can Be Linked to Increase in Voter Registration</h1>
	
	<h2> Recent data shows that voter registration in Brooklyn has increased by 11% since 2014's Midterm Elections. </h2>

<p> In the wake of last Tuesday's Midterm elections, early data shows that voter turnout was significantly higher than previous years. Historically, New York has been considered a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/new-yorks-worst-in-the-country-voting-system/570223/">non-voting State</a>. This can be linked to the fact that New York does not have early voting--which would help thousands of people who can't take the day off from work to vote--and places tough restrictions on absentee voting. In Brooklyn, data shows that since the 2014 Midterm Elections, voter registration rose over 11%, making it the highest it's ever been in the borough. </p>

<p>Although the largest spike registrations falls on the Women's Equality Party founded in 2015--now with over 800 members--it was the Democratic Party that benefited the most from the increase in registrations. Many believe that the reasons so many have registered to vote is because of the current political climate. </p>

<p>"I've never seen so many people be so motivated," said Ari Wolf, having just finished voting in Sunset Park. "I feel like it has a lot to do with Trump. The decision makers of this country don't seem to have the people in mind, and I feel like everyone is tired of it." </p>

<p>The biggest issue with a higher voter registration and higher turnout is that New York is not equipped to handle large voting masses. Long lines, broken voting machines, and understaffed polling sites are only a handfull of the issues that took place on Tuesday. Nevertheless, The increase of registration and participation in the last five years predicts that even more people will be registering and heading out to vote in the 2020 Presidential Elections. </p>
